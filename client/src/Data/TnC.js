  tnc: "We are delighted to welcome users to our innovative platform, Need4Need, dedicated to addressing critical societal issues such as food wastage, hunger, and rising fuel and fertilizer prices. By using our website, users agree to actively contribute to our mission of minimizing food wastage by participating in the collection and distribution of surplus food from events, hotels, and homes to both stray animals and those in need. We appreciate the collaboration with users in providing leftover vegetables to vendors, ensuring that no edible produce goes to waste. In our commitment to sustainability, the organic waste collected will be transformed into biogas and manure, made available to farmers at affordable rates, thus revolutionizing the agricultural process. Our decentralized blockchain-based platform ensures transparency and immutability in all transactions, setting us apart from traditional approaches. Users are encouraged to participate in the ongoing learning process, providing feedback and supporting the integration of an AI model to detect spoiled food. We look forward to launching the product in the market for real-world testing and appreciate the positive impact each user contributes to this transformative initiative.",
